# AI Studio Project: Text-Analytical Personality Predictor 

This is the repo for our Break Through Tech Fall 2025 AI Studio Challenge Project.

Our goal: we will prompt users to write us a paragraph with certain indicators of what we would like in their response. The users' block of text in response to our prompt will be the input for our model. We will assess their response and determine what personality type they identify with given their answer

We are currently using the following datasets for this project: 
- MBTI dataset ('type' and 'posts')
- Consider if we plan to use Human Characteristics Data 

The following datasets will be used for Caricon 2B's part of the project (career matching): 
- Onet Human Characteristics Data (numerous columns)
- There is also a Onet Human Character
- Onet salary data (numerous columns)
